python parser

They are hiding in this python and they think I don't reach them there.

## Introduction

This is the first, not ended, and actually a just started version of the python parser in java.

Project is divided in three parts.

1. In this step, we have already overcome the python syntax detection.

2. The parsed python will be remembered in java objects, this is done in 70% about.

3. The last step will be to transfer the objects from memory to text, 0% for now.


Java objects for storing language code are organized in a very simple tree.

Both the content and the variety of these objects can be adapted to any needs and will be time to time changed to be more suitable.

The task of this project will be to transform objects obtained from the python parser into objects from which Java code can be created.
