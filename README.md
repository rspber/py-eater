python parser

They are hiding in this python and they think I don't reach them there.

## Introduction

This is the first, not ended, and actually a just started version of the python parser in java.

Project is divided in three parts.

1. In this step, we have already overcome the python syntax detection.

2. The parsed python will be remembered in java objects, this is done in 70% about.

3. The last step will be to transfer the objects from memory to text, 0% for now.
