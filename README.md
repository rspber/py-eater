They are hiding in this python and they think I don't reach them there.

## Introduction

This is the second version of the python parser in java.

Project is divided in three parts.

1. In this step, we have already overcome the python syntax detection, this is done in above 95% about.

2. The parsed python is remembered in java objects, this is done in above 95% about.

3. The last step is to transfer the objects from memory to text, above 95% overall but 40% with sense for now.


Java objects for storing language code are very very simple and are organized in a very simple tree.

Both the content and the variety of these objects can be adapted to any needs and will be time to time changed to be more suitable.

The task of this project is to transform objects obtained from the python parser into objects from which Java code can be created.

For this task to be feasible, the entire project tree is accessible so that class contents and object types can be determined.

And for the end, such objects tree can be executable, so testing debug will be possible.
